With chances of finding more survivors faded, heavy machines are operating at full speed to remove the top of the rubble pile and dig holes into its sides to reach areas where bodies are likely to be located, the governor said. The top layer of rubble would be removed gradually for the safety of rescuers at the site of the collapsed new State Audit Office building in Chatuchak district, Bangkok. When the top part is secured, heavy machines would dig into the sides of the rubble mountain to reach what used to be the stairways, passages and halls that construction workers used to enter the 30-storey building before it fell. During the Myanmar earthquake on March 28 which shook the State Audit tower, construction personnel were likely trying to escape the high-rise through the passages, Mr Chadchart said. Two bodies were found in passages on Saturday and body parts were spotted on Sunday morning, he said. Whenever excavators reached a hole under the rubble, they would pave the way for rescuers and sniffer dogs to find more victims, the Bangkok governor said. He admitted the chance of still finding survivors was negligible. “The situation improved as we began to remove unstable areas and gained better access. We expect to find more missing persons. However, realistically, the chances of survival are diminishing, and the number of fatalities is likely to increase,” the Bangkok governor said. As of 8am on Sunday, 17 people were confirmed dead, 77 others were missing and nine had been rescued at the collapse site. Suriyachai Rawiwan, disaster mitigation director of City Hall, said drones were used to look for victims while excavators were operated. Deputy Bangkok governor Tavida Kamolvej said that the removal of the rubble at the new State Audit Office would take about a month.', 'image': 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20250406/c1_2996892_700.jpg', 'site_url': 'https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2996892/no-signs-of-life-more-bodies-expected-at-collapsed-tower-bangkok-governor', 'publish_date': '6 Apr 2025', 'publish_time': '17:14'}\n",

The bombshell judgement stunned France\\'s political establishment, and some leftwing forces and the centrist camp also planned to stage counter-rallies on Sunday. \"People of France, let us mobilise to defend freedom, save democracy and support Marine!\" Le Pen\\'s National Rally (RN) party said on X ahead of the protest in Paris. The far right is on the rise in France. Polls indicate Le Pen, 56, would easily top the first round of the two-round presidential vote if she ran. She describes herself as the \"favourite\" to succeed President Emmanuel Macron. On Monday, Le Pen, 56, was found guilty of embezzling European Parliament funds and given a partly suspended jail term and an immediate ban on holding public office. Her supporters branded the ruling politically motivated, but Macron insisted the French judiciary is \"independent\". US President Donald Trump called the sentence a \"witch hunt\" by \"European leftists using lawfare to silence free speech, and censor their political opponent\". Prime Minister Francois Bayrou rejected that remark as \"interference\" in French affairs, in a newspaper interview released Saturday. He added that it was \"neither healthy nor desirable\" to stage a demonstration against the court ruling, insisting French institutions allowed for \"the separation of powers and the defence of justice\". \"The Republic is under threat,\" Greens leader Marine Tondelier said on X, urging supporters to rally in central Paris on Sunday. Macron\\'s Renaissance party, led by former prime minister Gabriel Attal, 36, gathered in the northern working-class Paris suburb of Seine-Denis. Bayrou has been invited to attend the meeting, which has been in preparation for weeks. \"One of the questions that will arise on Sunday is whether or not we want France to become Trump\\'s America\", said one of Attal\\'s associates. Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old head of the National Rally, said the ruling would only boost support for the party. He has called the far-right rally in Place Vauban in Paris\\'s affluent 7th district \"a mobilisation not against, but in support of French democracy.\" According to police sources, 8,000 people are expected to attend. Le Pen has worked to turn the party into an electable mainstream force and rid it of the legacy of her father, its co-founder Jean-Marie Le Pen, who died in January and was frequently accused of racism. The latest survey by pollster Elabe for broadcaster BFMTV, released Saturday, showed her with up to 36 percent of the vote. Even some of her fiercest opponents say the far-right leader should be allowed to stand in the 2027 vote. She has lodged an appeal. But now Le Pen risks seeing years of progress undone, political observers say. After the ruling, she accused authorities of using a \"nuclear bomb\" against her. She compared herself to Alexei Navalny, the jailed Russian opposition leader who died in an Arctic prison in 2024 after being jailed under President Vladimir Putin. \"Indecent to the end,\" said left-leaning daily Liberation in its verdict on that claim. \"She is forced to adopt an anti-establishment point of view and position,\" said Jean-Yves Dormagen, president of Cluster17, an opinion analysis institute. \"Victimisation works with her voters.\" The National Rally is the largest single party in parliament and can complicate life for Bayrou, who does not have a majority in the lower house. His predecessor Michel Barnier was ejected from office last December in a move backed by Le Pen. The Paris Court of Appeal said it would examine Le Pen\\'s case within a timeframe that could potentially allow her to contest the polls if her conviction is overturned or her sentence changed.', 'image': 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20250406/c1_5544657_700.jpg', 'site_url': 'https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2996902/frances-far-right-leftwingers-rally-supporters-after-le-pen-conviction', 'publish_date': '6 Apr 2025', 'publish_time': '17:45'}\n",

Mr Anutin on Sunday spoke to the media to address recent allegations posted by the Facebook page “CSI LA,” which questioned his close relationship with Mr Montien. The page said their friendship might affect the investigation into the disaster. Mr Anutin admitted he and Mr Montien have been close friends for over a decade, having studied together during a national defence course where Mr Anutin was class president and Mr Monthien served as his secretary. However, this didn’t mean the probe into the SAO collapse would necessarily be tainted or inadequate. He denied the accusations made by the Facebook page. The minister said Mr Montien did not sign the contract for the building as he only assumed his position at the end of last year when the building was already near completion. He also criticised the CSI LA page for making false allegations, saying the pictures of him and Mr Montien shared by the page were taken a long time ago. Mr Anutin said the investigation is being carried out independently by a committee consisting of the Council of Engineers, the Engineering Institute of Thailand and several universities. “Manipulation or distortion was impossible. Even if it had been possible, it wouldn’t have caused the building to collapse,” he said. He had chatted to Mr Montien on Saturday, saying both agreed the accusations were untrue. “There’s no way we could bail anyone out of taking responsibility,” Mr Anutin added. “I’m the one urging all parties to find the cause because out of hundreds of thousands of buildings in Bangkok, this was the only building that collapsed, meaning it must have had a serious flaw,” he added. Meanwhile, Deputy Commerce Minister Napintorn Srisanpang said legal action will be taken against Thai shareholders of China Railway No.10 (Thailand), one of the contractors for the SAO building, if they are found to have acted as proxies for others to invest through. The Department of Special Investigation (DSI) will lead the probe and all findings concerning other companies connected to China Railway No.10 will be passed to the department for further investigation, he added.

Thank you very much\", the 88-year old pope said as he was wheeled through Saint Peter\\'s Square in his wheelchair after a mass dedicated to the sick. Surrounded by a mass of smartphones and cameras, and attached to nasal breathing tubes, his voice was fragile but more audible than when he left the Gemelli hospital on March 23. The Argentine\\'s last public appearance was on February 14. Francis is, in theory, undergoing two months of convalescence following his life-threatening health scare, with strict rest, no public activity and no contact with crowds. Yet the Jesuit spent Sunday morning blessing the masses gathered on the sunny square, in an encouraging signal for his health two weeks before Christians the world over celebrate Easter. \"He\\'s doing better, that\\'s clear, and he wants that to be seen,\" a Vatican source told AFP on condition of anonymity. \"He\\'s not yet well enough to deliver a message, but well enough to make a gesture... and show up,\" the source added. A few minutes before his surprise appearance the leader of the globe\\'s 1.4 billion Catholics received the sacrament in St Peter\\'s Cathedral, the Vatican said in a statement on Telegram. As in previous weeks Francis did not read out the customary Angelus prayer, which was published in written form instead. \"I pray for the doctors, the nurses and the healthcare workers, who are not always helped to work in adequate conditions and who are even, sometimes, victims of attacks,\" the pontiff wrote. \"Their mission is not easy and must be supported and respected.\" His message went on to offer a prayer for an end to the world\\'s conflicts, mentioning in turn Ukraine, Sudan, neighbouring South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar and Haiti. Francis likewise prayed for the Middle East and especially Gaza, where Israel last week again launched a ground offensive against Palestinian militant group Hamas. In the Palestinian territory \"people are forced to live in unimaginable conditions, without shelter, without food, without drinkable water,\" the pope said. \"Let the weapons fall silent and dialogue begin again\", he added, calling for the freeing of the hostages held by Hamas since its October 7, 2023 attack that began the war. While being assisted his recovery by healthcare workers night and day at his Vatican residence, Francis has not seen any visitors since his release from the Gemelli Hospital. Yet he has taken up his papal duties again, notably in editing and putting his signature to documents, according to the Holy See.', 'image': 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20250406/c1_5544687_700.jpg', 'site_url': 'https://www.bangkokpost.com/world/2996917/recovering-pope-surprises-crowd-at-vatican-square', 'publish_date': '6 Apr 2025', 'publish_time': '18:45'}\n",

US President Donald Trump\\'s announcement of sweeping tariffs on Wednesday shows that \"old assumptions can no longer be taken for granted,\" Starmer said in an op-ed for the Sunday Telegraph newspaper. \"The world as we knew it has gone,\" he wrote. The new world will be governed less by established rules and \"more by deals and alliances\", added the prime minister. The tariffs have already sent markets into a tailspin, and all eyes will be on Monday\\'s opening with Trump warning Americans of pain ahead. \"This is an economic revolution, and we will win,\" the Republican president wrote on Truth Social on Saturday. \"Hang tough, it won\\'t be easy, but the end result will be historic.\" Trump\\'s 34% tariff on Chinese goods is set to kick in next week, triggering Beijing\\'s announcement of a 34% levy on US products from April 10. The EU and Japan are also among around 60 trading partners set to face even higher rates on April 9, raising fears of recessions in some of the world\\'s leading economies. Wednesday\\'s announcement has sent countries scrambling for a response, and Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa said Saturday that he would suspend all tariffs on goods imported from the US after being hit with an 18% levy. The UK has so far got off relatively lightly with a 10% tariff, and Starmer wrote on Sunday that the country\\'s response \"demands the best of British virtues -– cool heads, pragmatism and a clear understanding of our national interest.\" The UK leader reiterated his government\\'s belief that \"nobody wins from a trade war\" and that the immediate strategy was \"to keep calm and fight for the best deal.\" However, he insisted a US trade deal will only be struck \"if it is right for British business\" and that \"all options remain on the table\" in responding to the tariffs. The new levies mark \"the most sweeping tariff hike since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, the 1930 law best remembered for triggering a global trade war and deepening the Great Depression,\" said the Center for Strategic and International Studies. In an immediate sign of the fallout, UK luxury car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover said on Saturday that it will \"pause\" shipments to the United States in April as it addressed \"the new trading terms\". Recognising the shifting global economic sands, Starmer said that he was now prepared to use direct state intervention to protect certain sectors. \"This week we will turbocharge plans that will improve our domestic competitiveness,\" he wrote, ahead of an expected major announcement on industrial strategy. \"We stand ready to use industrial policy to help shelter British business from the storm. \"Some people may feel uncomfortable about this... but we simply cannot cling on to old sentiments when the world is turning this fast,\" he added.', 'image': 'https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20250406/c1_5544677_700.jpg', 'site_url': 'https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/2996912/uk-readies-to-protect-industry-as-us-tariffs-upend-global-order-starmer', 'publish_date': '6 Apr 2025', 'publish_time': '18:45'}\n",

The party celebrated the milestone at its headquarters on Sunday with a merit-making ceremony led by Mr Anutin and party secretary-general Chaichanok Chidchob. The ceremony featured both Buddhist and Islamic rituals, which were meant to highlight the diversity within the party. Representatives from other parties, including Pheu Thai, Chartthaipattana, United Thai Nation and Democrat parties, also attended the event. After the ceremonies concluded, the party kicked off its annual general assembly, during which party members discussed revisions to internal regulations and formalised the adoption of the new all-blue logo. Even before the all-blue logo was adopted, Bhumjaithai Party was often referred to as the “Blue Party” by the public and in media reports. Mr Anutin said the colour symbolises the party’s commitment to Thai identity, patriotism, religious values and loyalty to the monarchy under a democratic system with the King as the head of state. In his speech about the new logo, Mr Anutin also highlighted the party’s resilience over the past 16 years, whether as a governing party or an opposition party. He emphasised the party’s commitment to serving the people, whether its members hold an official position or not. Mr Anutin said blue represents many things, including peace, unity, strength, stability, boldness, wisdom and loyalty, which are qualities that define Bhumjaithai’s ideology.

Rescuers have been working tirelessly to excavate Zone C of the site in Chatuchak district, as it is believed to be the place where many people ran from as the building collapsed during the earthquake on March 28. Aekvarunyoo Amrapala, a spokesman of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA), said a backhoe was being used to dig a hole in Zone C, which was linked to the building’s car park floors. It is possible that the bodies of some of the workers who were fleeing during the collapse would be found there, he said. A total of 79 people are still unaccounted for at the site where the 30-storey building collapsed. A small backhoe has been deployed to Zone B but a larger one is needed to reduce the debris pile and lessen the risks for rescuers who will attempt to retrieve bodies of missing people there, said the spokesman. At about 2.30am, Mr Aekvarunyoo received a report that a body had been spotted trapped under the rubble in Zone B, but rescuers were unable to go inside yet. The BMA’s Erawan Medical Emergency Centre reported on Saturday evening that the confirmed death toll at the site stood at 15 and the number of injured was 19. Of the injured, 11 have been discharged from hospitals, leaving 8 being treated.',\n",

       "  'content': 'COLOMBO - India and the United Arab Emirates have agreed to develop an energy hub in Sri Lanka, the Indian foreign ministry said on Saturday, as New Delhi’s competition with China grows in the Indian Ocean island nation. The three nations signed the pact for the hub during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Sri Lanka, the first by a global leader since Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake took office in September. New Delhi and Colombo have worked to deepen ties as India’s southern neighbour recovers from a severe financial crisis triggered in 2022, during which India provided $4 billion in financial assistance. Saturday’s agreement boosts New Delhi’s competition with China, whose state energy firm Sinopec has signed a deal to build a $3.2-billion oil refinery in the southern port city of Hambantota. The energy hub in the strategically important city of Trincomalee, a natural harbour in the Sri Lanka’s east, will involve construction of a multi-product pipeline and may include using a World War II tank farm partly held by the Sri Lankan subsidiary of Indian Oil Corp, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters in Colombo. “The UAE is a strategic partner for India in the energy space and therefore was an ideal partner for this exercise that is being done for the first time in the region,” Misri said. “The exact contours of the UAE’s role will be elaborated once the business-to-business discussions kick off.” The three nations will next choose business entities that will consider the financing and feasibility of projects for the hub, he said. Modi also inaugurated a $100-million solar power project, a joint venture between Ceylon Electricity Board and India’s National Thermal Power Corp. India and Sri Lanka also concluded their debt restructuring process, Misri said. Sri Lanka owes about $1.36 billion in loans to the Exim Bank of India and State Bank of India, according to Sri Lankan Finance Ministry data. Colombo began restructuring talks after it defaulted on its debt in May 2022, signing a preliminary deal with bilateral creditors Japan, India and China last June. India and Sri Lanka also signed pacts on power grid connectivity, digitisation, security and healthcare.',\n",

She and her husband Des, 77, were badly beaten by two neighbours after a property dispute in Hua Hin, where they had purchased a villa.

The couple’s passports were seized and they endured a months-long wait to learn of their fate. Last month the couple finally appeared in court, where they were fined and had their passports returned to them. They have now abandoned their plans to retire in Thailand and are instead looking at houses in Middlesbrough. “Being back in Middlesbrough and seeing the fabulous countryside, it’s absolutely wonderful,” Mrs Byrne told the BBC. “We couldn’t be happier.” Since getting back to England the couple have stayed with a family in Berkshire but plan to settle back on their native Teesside once they find a home.

After travelling to the Southeast Asian country, the three staff were told late this week that they would be let go, Marcia Wong, a former official at the US Agency for International Development (USAID), told Reuters. “This team is working incredibly hard, focussed on getting humanitarian aid to those in need. To get news of your imminent termination — how can that not be demoralising?” said Wong, former deputy administrator of the agency’s Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance, which oversees Washington’s disease response efforts overseas. President Donald Trump’s government has pledged at least $9 million to Myanmar after the magnitude-7.7 quake, which has killed more than 3,300 people. But his administration’s massive cuts to USAID have hindered its ability to respond, while China, Russia, India and other nations have rushed in assistance. The Trump administration has moved to fire nearly all USAID staff in recent weeks, as billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency has slashed funding and dismissed contractors across the federal bureaucracy in what it calls an attack on wasteful spending. The three USAID workers have been sleeping on the streets in the earthquake zone, Wong said, adding that their terminations would take effect in a few months. Many residents have been sleeping outside for fear of aftershocks and further building collapses. Wong said she is in contact with remaining USAID staff and that she heard about the terminations after an all-staff meeting on Friday. Former staff say most of the people who would have coordinated the response have been let go, while third-party implementing partners have lost contracts. \\xa0 The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday rejected criticism that Washington was slow to respond to the March 28 earthquake because USAID was dismantled. Rather, he told reporters in Brussels, Myanmar was not “the easiest place to work”, saying the military government does not like the United States and prevents it from operating in the country as it wants to. The United Nations has said the junta was limiting humanitarian aid. Rubio said the US would no longer be the world’s top humanitarian donor, accounting for what he estimated was 70% of all global relief funding. He has called on other wealthy nations to step up in assisting Myanmar.',\n",

       "  'content': 'The Philippines said the detention of three Filipinos in China for alleged espionage may be in retaliation for Manila’s recent arrests of Chinese nationals accused of spying. The Filipinos were former scholars of the Hainan provincial government under an agreement with Palawan province in the Philippines, the National Security Council said in a statement on Saturday without identifying the individuals. They have no military training “with no criminal records and were vetted and screened by the Chinese government prior to their arrival there”, it said. “Given the limited information released by Chinese media, the arrests can be seen as a retaliation for the series of legitimate arrests of Chinese agents and accomplices by Philippine law enforcement and counter-intelligence agencies in recent months,” the statement read. Beijing said on Thursday that it had detained three Filipinos who it claimed were operatives for Manila and carried out secret intelligence tasks in China. It said the espionage case against David Servañez, Albert Endencia and Nathalie Plizardo is under investigation. The latest flare-up could heighten tensions between the two countries that are already engaged in a territorial dispute in the South China Sea, as Manila pushes back against Beijing’s expansive claims in the resource-rich waterway. Philippine authorities arrested several Chinese nationals earlier this year for alleged espionage, including six last month who were suspected of carrying out intelligence and surveillance operations of critical infrastructure in the country. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr earlier said he was “very disturbed” over the increasing number of alleged Chinese spies arrested in the Philippines, which has prompted security officials to tighten monitoring. The Philippines’ security council said that a video released by China’s state broadcaster in which the three Filipinos expressed regret “appear to be scripted, strongly suggesting that (the confessions) were not made freely”. The security council said it was working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine embassy in Beijing to ensure that the Filipinos receive appropriate legal support and are accorded due process. “We urge the Chinese government to respect their rights and afford them every opportunity to clear their names in the same way that the rights of Chinese nationals are respected here in the Philippines,” it added.',\n",

       "  'content': 'The inbound and outbound lanes of the Din Daeng toll plaza on the Chalerm Maha Nakhon Expressway in Bangkok will be closed at night from Saturday until Monday to accommodate the removal of a construction crane tower that was damaged in the March 28 earthquake. The Expressway Authority of Thailand (Exat) said the closure would take place from 10pm to 6am on April 5-7. The crane tower in question was being used at the Aspire Vibha-Victory condominium project site and its collapse also affected the expressway, Exat said on its Facebook page. Exat apologised for any inconvenience and advised motorists to use the following alternative routes. Outbound: Vehicles travelling on the Chalerm Maha Nakhon Expressway from Rama V Road (Bon Kai) should use the Si Rat Expressway heading towards Phahon Yothin Road (Victory Monument) exit or the Rama IX (Ratchada) exit to enter Din Daeng and Vibhavadi roads. Vehicles travelling on the Si Rat Expressway should use the Ploenchit exit (north side) to reach Asok Road and head towards Din Daeng and Vibhavadi roads. Inbound: Vehicles heading to Bang Na should use the Si Rat Expressway at the Bang Sue toll plaza in front of Mor Chit Bus Terminal 2 or Klong Prapa 2 toll plaza in front of the Ministry of Finance. The damaged crane tower is seen at the Aspire Vibha-Victory condominium construction site in Din Daeng district of Bangkok on March 29. (Photo: Din Daeng District Office Facebook page)',\n",

       "  'content': 'A Chinese tourist holding a Thailand Privilege Card visa was found dead on a beach in Pattaya on Saturday morning, with some bruises on his forehead and neck. The body of the 40-year-old man, whose name was withheld pending notification of relatives, was found lying face-down on Yin Yom beach behind a hotel in South Pattaya, said Pol Lt Col Saijai Khamjulla, investigation inspector at the Pattaya City police station, who was alerted at 7.30am. Wearing a white T-shirt and jeans, the man had some bruises — one on his forehead and one on his neck. His right eye socket was fractured and there were traces of blood from his nostrils, according to an initial examination. A doctor believed he had died at least six to 12 hours before the body was discovered. A mobile phone and a slipper were found near his body. A passport and a bank passbook showing 60,000 baht cash were found on his body. According to police, a hotel staff member was cleaning the beach area behind the hotel and saw the man lying face-down in the sand. She immediately alerted police and said the man was not a guest of the hotel. An immigration record check showed the man entered Thailand on a tourist visa under the Thailand Privilege Card scheme for wealthy frequent visitors. He first entered the kingdom in 2023 and travelled in and out of the country frequently. His last reported address was in the seaside village of Jomtien, about 2-3 kilometres from where the body was found. Pol Col Anek Srathongyu, chief of the Pattaya City station, said the exact cause of death had not yet been established. The report of the doctor who examined the body said it was possible that the deceased had slipped and fallen, with his head striking a rock, causing him to lose consciousness. He might have later drowned in the sea, said the police chief. The body would be sent to Police General Hospital in Bangkok for a full autopsy to establish the cause of death, said Pol Col Anek.',\n",

       "  'content': 'LIVERPOOL, England - Everton did neighbours Liverpool a massive favour by holding title-chasing Arsenal to a 1-1 Premier League draw at Goodison Park on Saturday. Iliman Ndiaye’s penalty cancelled out a Leandro Trossard opener for the visitors, who now have 62 points from 31 matches, 11 behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game at hand when they go to Fulham on Sunday. Everton climb to 14th place with 35 points from their 31 matches, 15 points clear of the relegation zone. Arsenal took the lead in the 34th minute with the first shot on target in the game as a poor header in midfield allowed Raheem Sterling to race clear and feed Trossard, who took a touch and drilled his shot low into the far right corner. Everton were awarded a penalty two minutes into the second half when Myles Lewis-Skelly hauled down Jack Harrison in the box and Ndiaye netted his ninth goal of the season in all competitions to leave Arsenal’s flagging title hopes in tatters. Liverpool now need just 11 points from their remaining eight matches to secure a record-equalling 20th English top-flight title. Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta had said the best preparation for his side’s Champions League quarter-final, first leg against Real Madrid would be to win on Merseyside on Saturday. But the Spaniard showed he had one eye on the visit of the European champions with his team selection. Bukayo Saka was forced to wait for his first start since December as the England international was left on the bench alongside Martin Odegaard, Gabriel Martinelli, Jurrien Timber and Thomas Partey. Despite also missing Gabriel Magalhaes, Kai Havertz and Gabriel Jesus to long-term injuries, Arsenal were still the dominant force in the first 45 minutes. Arsenal’s title bid, though, has been undone throughout the season by not scoring enough goals, even when Havertz and Jesus were fit earlier in the campaign.',\n",
